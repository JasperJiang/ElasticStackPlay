## What is Kibana

Explore and visualize your data and manage all things Elastic Stack.

Whether you’re a user or admin, Kibana makes your data actionable by providing three key functions. Kibana is:

+ **An open-source analytics and visualization platform.** Use Kibana to explore your Elasticsearch data, and then build beautiful visualizations and dashboards.
+ **A UI for managing the Elastic Stack.** Manage your security settings, assign user roles, take snapshots, roll up your data, and more — all from the convenience of a Kibana UI.
+ **A centralized hub for Elastic’s solutions.** From log analytics to document discovery to SIEM, Kibana is the portal for accessing these and other capabilities.
